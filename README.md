# esp8266-kettle-alexa
Alexa home automation using esp8266 board w/ wifi to control an electric kettle

Most of this code is directly adapted from the kakopapa/sinric github site.  
https://github.com/kakopappa/sinric

I added code for controlling the servo which will switch on the kettle. 

You will need to follow the directions on the README to setup the sinric (free) account 
then create a device for the electric kettle to control.

This sketch will turn a servo to switch on an electric kettle using alexa.   It uses an wemos mini d1 board which is an esp8266 
with wifi adapter built in.
